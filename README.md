## Deployment Notes
This app requires a Python server environment to run. GitHub Pages only supports static content and cannot host Python apps. To deploy your Shiny for Python app, use a platform like [Shiny for Python hosting](https://www.shiny.posit.co/py/), Heroku, or similar Python web hosting services.
